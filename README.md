## 🧠 Philosophy: Simple, Local, Educational  

This system was designed with **education**, **modularity**, and **practical usage** in mind.

### 🔒 Offline-First  
Everything runs locally — no server or internet needed.

### 🧩 Modular Architecture  
Each major feature (**booking**, **viewing**, **adding flights**) is isolated into separate pages/files for easier understanding and extension.

### 👩‍💻 Beginner-Friendly Codebase  
Clear naming, straightforward layout management, and organized folder structure make it ideal for new Python GUI developers.

### 💡 Realistic Airline Use Case  
Simulates essential functions an airline clerk or admin would perform in a real-world system.

## 🌍 Vision

The **Airline Management System** aims to provide a simple, efficient, and user-friendly platform for managing basic airline operations such as flight scheduling, ticket booking, and passenger records — all within a standalone desktop application.

Designed primarily for educational and small-scale use cases, the system focuses on:

- ✈️ Simplifying complex airline workflows into easy-to-use modules  
- 🧠 Teaching students real-world CRUD operations using Python and SQLite  
- 🧩 Offering a modular and extendable codebase for learning and customization  
- 🔒 Enabling offline functionality to ensure accessibility in low-resource environments

Our long-term vision is to grow this into a full-featured educational platform where learners and developers can experiment, enhance, and deploy their own versions of airline management tools — both for practice and practical use.
